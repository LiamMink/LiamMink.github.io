<p style="font-family:verdana">Descripton: My app consists of various buttons that play therapeutic sounds conducive to relieving stress as well as sleep.  During the duration in which I was developing I experienced various tribulations in my code which I had debug, through these trials my knowledge and confidence of the coding process was boosted.  My app consists of three event handlers that when a button is pressed plays various therapeutic sounds and stops all other sounds being played besides the chosen sound. Another three event handlers allow the user to pause the sound they're playing when a button is pressed.  And finally my program has another event handler that ceases all sounds being played when a button is pressed.  What I liked most about this program is independence I gained and creative freedom I was granted. Something that I could improve upon my app is more available sounds, and more conducive user interface.
